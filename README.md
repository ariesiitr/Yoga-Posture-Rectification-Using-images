# Yoga-Posture-Detection-And-Rectification

Yoga has become popular throughout the world. Most people, while practicing yoga themselves, face difficulties in finding the incorrect parts of their yoga poses. Performing yoga asanas in an improper way may cause acute injuries and unnecessary pain. 
Yoga-Posture-Rectification is an AI yoga Assistant which detects the pose performed by a person in real-timedraws skeleton and provides the feedback to the user by comparing his pose with the ideal pose.
We have used tensorflow yoga image dataset consisting of approx. 200 images of each yoga pose for training the model. Movenet is being used to detect the human pose in images and extract the key-points while a neural network model is used to classify the pose. We have used React js for frontend development.
